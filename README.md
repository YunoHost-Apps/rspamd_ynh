## Overview

Rspamd is an advanced spam filtering system that allows evaluation of messages by a number of rules including regular expressions, statistical analysis and custom services such as URL black lists. Each message is analysed by Rspamd and given a spam score.

According to this spam score and the userâ€™s settings, Rspamd recommends an action for the MTA to apply to the message, for example, to pass, reject or add a header. Rspamd is designed to process hundreds of messages per second simultaneously, and provides a number of useful features.


**Shipped version:** 3.11.0~ynh1
